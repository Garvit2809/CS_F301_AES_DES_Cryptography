# Relation with the course 

## 1. Memory Safety and Ownership in Rust
Rust's emphasis on memory safety, driven by its ownership system and borrow checker, significantly influences the implementation of both AES and DES. The ownership system ensures that cryptographic operations are conducted without the risk of common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows. This is particularly critical in the context of cryptographic algorithms where low-level operations demand precision and robust memory management. The borrow checker guarantees the validity of references, mitigating memory-related errors. The meticulous handling of memory in Rust contributes not only to the security of the implementation but also to the predictability of memory usage.

## 2. Performance Optimization in C++
C++'s focus on performance optimization becomes evident in the execution of cryptographic algorithms, especially with the resource-intensive AES algorithm. The language provides fine-grained control over low-level details, allowing for manual memory management and optimization tailored to the computational complexities of cryptographic operations. In the context of AES, where intricate mathematical operations are prevalent, C++ empowers developers to fine-tune the code for optimal execution. The numbers attest to this, showcasing C++'s prowess in handling computationally intensive tasks with a balance of speed and efficiency.

## 3. Strong Typing and Security in Rust
Rust's strong typing plays a crucial role in ensuring the consistency and correctness of data handling in cryptographic implementations. The emphasis on strong typing minimizes the risk of unintended data manipulations, aligning with the project's commitment to security. The AES and DES algorithms benefit from Rust's type system, as it prevents type-related errors that could compromise the integrity of the cryptographic operations. While Rust introduces an additional layer of type safety, the implementation demonstrates that this does not come at the expense of performance, as evidenced by competitive execution times.

## 4. Ownership, Borrowing, and Concurrency in Rust
The application of Rust's ownership and borrowing principles extends beyond memory safety. In the context of cryptographic algorithms, ownership and borrowing contribute to safe concurrency. The AES and DES implementations in Rust are inherently equipped to handle parallel processing, ensuring that data races do not compromise the security and correctness of the cryptographic operations. Rust's ownership system shines as a powerful ally in maintaining thread safety without sacrificing the performance needed for efficient encryption and decryption.

## 5. Benchmarking and Profiling
The project incorporates benchmarking and profiling tools to quantitatively assess the performance characteristics of both C++ and Rust implementations. Profilers such as Dhat and VTune Profiler allow us to delve into the memory utilization, CPU usage, and execution times. These numbers are not just metrics; they are a reflection of the impact of language choices on the real-world execution of cryptographic algorithms. The benchmarks serve as tangible proof points, validating the effectiveness of language-specific features and optimizations in achieving the project's goals.

## Cryptographic Tool Features

## Implementation Details

### Language Choice
The tool is implemented in both **Rust** and **C++**, providing insights into the strengths and considerations of each language in the context of cryptography. Rust's focus on memory safety and C++'s emphasis on performance are juxtaposed to showcase the impact of language choice on cryptographic implementations.

### Encryption Techniques

#### AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
The AES encryption algorithm is implemented in `AES_encrypt.cpp` for the C++ version. The core `AESEncrypt` function orchestrates the encryption process, initializing a state, executing initial and main rounds, and finally copying the encrypted state to the buffer.

#### AES Decryption
The counterpart for decryption is implemented in `AES_decrypt.cpp`. The `AESDecrypt` function manages initialization, initial rounds, main rounds in reverse order, and the final round of AES decryption.

#### DES (Data Encryption Standard)
The DES encryption and decryption implementation resides in `des.cpp`. Operating on 64-bit blocks of data with a 56-bit key, the code allows users to interactively input an operation (encrypt or decrypt), a 16-character message in hexadecimal form, and a 16-character key.

### Key Generation
Round keys for encryption and decryption in DES are generated using the `key_rounds` function, derived from the user-provided key.

### DES Encryption
For encryption, the code conducts initial permutation, splitting the message, 16 rounds of encryption (including expansion, XOR with round keys, S-box substitution, and permutation), and final permutation. The result is then converted to a hexadecimal string and presented to the user.

### DES Decryption
Decryption involves reversing the encryption process with initial permutation, splitting, 16 rounds of decryption using the round keys in reverse order, and final permutation. The plaintext result is converted to a hexadecimal string and displayed.
